## ðŸ“Œ Task 04: Hand Gesture Recognition Model

**Track:** Machine Learning Internship â€” Prodigy InfoTech

### âœ… Task Objective

Develop a **hand gesture recognition model** that can accurately classify different hand gestures from image or video frames to enable gesture-based human-computer interaction.

### ðŸš€ What I Did

- Loaded and explored the Leap Hand Gesture dataset.
- Preprocessed image data: resizing, normalization.
- Built a classifier (e.g., SVM or CNN â€” whichever you used).
- Trained and validated the model.
- Tested the modelâ€™s accuracy on unseen gestures.

### ðŸ“š What I Learned

- Image data handling for gesture recognition.
- Training models for multi-class image classification.
- Evaluating model performance for real-time applications.
- Applications of computer vision in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction).

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- [Leap Hand Gesture Recognition Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog)
- Download and place the dataset in a `data/` folder locally.
